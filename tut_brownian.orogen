# This task context generates MotionCommand2D that makes the object follow a
# brownian motion
#
# More specifically, the task generates straight movements of a random speed
# in the [min_speed, max_speed] interval during straight_duration seconds. It
# then switches to a point-turning motion of a random speed in [-angle, angle]
# radians per second during turn_duration seconds.
